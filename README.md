# UmiJS Example

This directory is a brief example of a [UmiJS](https://umijs.org/) app that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## How we created this example 

To get started with UmiJS on Now, you can use the [Umi CLI](https://github.com/umijs/create-umi) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ yarn create umi app-name
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the UmiJS example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
